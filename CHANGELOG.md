## 1.9.7 (September 26, 2012)
*This release has a bug in `/scripts/update_Tevo_tables-2012-09-26.mysql`. Use 1.9.8 instead.*

*This update contains changes that are NOT backwards compatible*

*Be sure to apply `/scripts/update_Tevo_tables-2012-09-26.mysql` to update your tables as necessary*

- Full rewrite of the Demo app
- Full rewrite of the Data Loaders for caching the API data locally. They are now classes, which means you can easily extend them to add additional features or tweaks as necessary.
- Deprecated some methods in `TicketEvolution_Webservice`. Deprecated methods will trigger an `E_USER_DEPRECATED` error. This was done in order to make the naming more consistent with TEvo naming and with the functionality of the methods.

- Changed some column names for clarity.


## 1.9.6 (June 8, 2012)

    - Dates are no longer returned as `Zend_Date` objects
    - Currencies are no longer converted to `Zend_Currency` objects
- Also added some new filters that can be used to filter ticket groups when displaying a list of them. Look for updates in [the Wiki](https://github.com/ticketevolution/ticketevolution-php/wiki) soon explaining how to use these.


## Feb 29, 2012
*This update contains changes that are NOT backwards compatible*

- Updated things to work with API v9. API versions <9 will not work with this release
- Both data-loaders and the demo now require the user to copy `config.sample.php` to `config.php` and set your credentials there


## Feb 28, 2012

## Feb 9, 2012
- Improvements to API demo app:
    - If an exception is thrown the actual request and response will be output for debugging purposes
    - Made it easier to switch between API environments (Sandbox|Production)
    - Changes reflect new changes to API

    - `/events/deleted`
    - `/performers/deleted`

- Code now passes Zend CodeSniffer tests with no errors


## July 25, 2011
- Fixed a bug in `buildRawSignature()` (in `Webservices.php`) in which parameter names were not being urlencoded (only the values were) which resulted in `401 Unauthorized` errors when attempting to `listEvents()` using `'performances[performer_id]='`.
- Cleaned up some of the code in `Webservices.php` to make it pass CodeSniffer using the Zend sniffs.


## July 5, 2011
*Bug fixes*
- In the configuration data-loader the `venueId` column was being populated with the `configurationId`.
- `ResultSet` was returning all results as `TicketEvolution_Searchresults` objects instead of the ones specific to their type of result.


## May 22, 2011

## May 20, 2011
- Added data-loaders which is a handy app for caching the data locally in MySQL. To use it you will need to run the `create_tables.mysql` script in scripts folder.
- Added `sortResults()` method to `ResultSet` to allow for sorting of results.
- Added `exclusiveResults()` and `excludeResults()` methods to `ResultSet` which allow you to easily show only TicketGroups from a specified array of brokers OR to exclude TicketGroups from a specified array of brokers. Handy if you prefer to only show your own inventory for certain events or if you wish to exclude someone's inventory.
- Added `search()` endpoint which searches venues and performers
- Many general improvements


## May 17, 2011
