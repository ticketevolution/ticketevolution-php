# Welcome to the Ticket Evolution Framework for PHP!

## RELEASE INFORMATION

### Jan 5, 2012
- Added support for new “deleted” endpoints:
    - `/events/deleted`
    - `/performers/deleted`
    - `/venues/deleted`
    - `/categories/deleted`
- Added support for using persistent connections, which now default to on. I have seen a considerable speedup with data loaders using persistent connections.
- No longer appends `?` to end of URL for API calls that have no parameters. The API used to require it be there regardless, but now it does not.
- Removed methods for checking if API URL was https now that https is required
- Markdown-ified the README

- Can now pass `?startPage=xx` to URLs to start at a specific page of the loop

### Aug 30, 2011
- Cleaned up/corrected some more documentation in `Webservice.php`
- Moved `TicketEvolution_ClientAddress` to `TicketEvolution_Address_Client`
- Moved `TicketEvolution_ClientEmailAddress` to `TicketEvolution_EmailAddress_Client`
- Moved `TicketEvolution_ClientPhoneNumber` to `TicketEvolution_PhoneNumber_Client`
- Corrected some documentation. You can create multiple client addresses/emails/phone numbers in a single API call
- Corrected demo app to show example of creating two client addresses at once
- Added new API features through v8 including client and order methods
- Much improved "Demo App"
    - Now shows exact PHP code used
    - Method selector re-ordered to match API documentation
    - Methods that affect data are disabled if you do not use the Sandbox API
- Much easier to override how the data is returned from API calls. Specify your own ResultSet and Result classes if you like as well as and "Post-Processing" of the JSON returned
- Code now passes Zend CodeSniffer tests with no errors

### July 25, 2011
- Fixed a bug in `buildRawSignature()` (in `Webservices.php`) in which parameter names were not being urlencoded (only the values were) which resulted in `401 Unauthorized` errors when attempting to `listEvents()` using `'performances[performer_id]='`.
- Cleaned up some of the code in `Webservices.php` to make it pass CodeSniffer using the Zend sniffs.

### July 5, 2011
*Bug fixes*
- In the configuration data-loader the `venueId` column was being populated with the `configurationId`.
- `ResultSet` was returning all results as `TicketEvolution_Searchresults` objects instead of the ones specific to their type of result.

### May 22, 2011
- Added ability to store seating chart URls in the `tevoConfigurations` table. In order to do so you will need to run the `update_Tevo_tables.mysql` script in the scripts folder.


### May 20, 2011
- Added data-loaders which is a handy app for caching the data locally in MySQL. To use it you will need to run the `create_tables.mysql` script in scripts folder.
- Added `sortResults()` method to `ResultSet` to allow for sorting of results.
- Added `exclusiveResults()` and `excludeResults()` methods to `ResultSet` which allow you to easily show only TicketGroups from a specified array of brokers OR to exclude TicketGroups from a specified array of brokers. Handy if you prefer to only show your own inventory for certain events or if you wish to exclude someone's inventory.
- Added `search()` endpoint which searches venues and performers
- Many general improvements

### May 17, 2011
- Updated endpoint in `Webservice.php` from `ticket-groups` to `ticket_groups` to reflect change in API.


### May 9, 2011.
